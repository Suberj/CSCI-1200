DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
Please be concise! (< 200 words)
What question you are trying to answer with your statistic? 
What data did you need to organize? 
What was interesting or challenging about the implementation of this statistic? 

The custom stat I made was listing all of the penalty names, and the
amount of time they occurred. I made them organized by the most occurring
penalties come first. This was pretty easy as I already had most of the code
written for the other classes I just tweaked them a little bit. I also had
a better understanding of classes at this point.
