DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SHIPFREIGHT ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimal (fastest train speed, most freight, fewest number
of engines used, and fewest resulting trains) for any input.  Note:
Student choice on how to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your
priorization and your implementation.

My goal for ShipFreight was to have the fewest number of trains used. To do 
this I would add the heaviest freight cars first and keep adding engines until
the max cars were added to the train. This would allow me to have the longest train
cars possible resulting in the fewest cars used.


DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SEPARATE ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimally comfortable trains (smaller values for average
distance to dining and/or larger values for closest engine to sleeper)
and/or optimally handling cases with > 2 engines.  Student choice on how 
to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your priorization and your
implementation.

I ran out of time to do this portion of the extracredit.
