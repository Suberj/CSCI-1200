TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

I used valgrind since my Dr. Memory stopped working for some reason, 
and I also utilized std::cout a lot (as I normally do).

To test the corner cases I test inserting many different values. This
would test inserting things into different spots on the trees. I also worked with
really big numbers, and really big trees. This lead to some errors but overall it works 
all right. I could not get my spacing right on some of the prints, and I am not sure why.
