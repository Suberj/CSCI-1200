# CSCI-1200
This is my work from Data Structures which I took at RPI my spring semester of my freshman year. This class was in C++ and we created and used our own data structures throughout the year.

Course Description: Programming concepts: functions, parameter passing, pointers, arrays, strings, structs, classes, templates. Mathematical tools: sets, functions, and relations, order notation, complexity of algorithms, proof by induction. Data structures and their representations: data abstraction and internal representation, sequences, trees, binary search trees, associative structures. Algorithms: searching and sorting, generic algorithms, iterative and recursive algorithms. Methods of testing correctness and measuring performance.
